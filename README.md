- 👋 Hi, I’m @pschleske
- 🌱 I currently use JS, NodeJS, and Python. React, and others for personal projects.
- 💞️ Currently employed but always looking for new opportunities
- 📫 Find me on LinkedIn
- Note: This is my personal github account, and I don't have many contributions since I had created a separate work account. I recently deleted my work account to work through my personal only. This is a known thing that I was completely unaware of- rookie mistake. Also, I have a lot of private repos due to company privacy.
